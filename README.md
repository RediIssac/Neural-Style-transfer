# Neural-Style-transfer

 I did two implementation and I compared them and I found that the other implementation
is better
---- the first implementation
VGG19 network
torch--- I found it easy to understand



I am running the orignal algorithm to compare my implementation with

* My implementation is bases on the original algorithm- and explain about the paper-- understand the paper first
Then try to find the flaws about that specific algorithm->  try to tune the hyper parameters so you can 
improve on it

* compare the result of the paper with the existing algorithm- see what special results they have done
if u can change it so that it accept two styles and synthesis the result
